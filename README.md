# Vulnerability-attack-Defence

### Prerequisites 
- Vulnerable virtual Network
- Attak Machine (Kali)
- VitualBox/VMware

### Project Idea
After installing kali and the virtual network , it is required to configure the ip addresses and put all thew Vms in the same Ip range for easier network access and scanning, after this step by using nmap , nessus, etc... scan the network , detect the vulnerabilities and expliot them to gain credential to the machine and retrieve some files and as the 2nd part of the project we use snort and iptables to block these vulnerabities and stopping the attack.
